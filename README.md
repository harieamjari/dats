# Dats
NOTE NOTE NOTE!! This repo has been moved to
https://github.com/dats-lang/dats-src

A digital audio text station.

The "Hello World" of dats:
```
staff pol {
  n 4, c4;
  n 4, d4;
  n 4, e4;
  n 4, f4;
  n 4, g4;
  n 4, a4;
  n 4, b4;
  n 4, c5;
}

master {
  // This uses the synthesizer named "kpa"
  // An implementation of Karplus-Strong Algorithm
  pcm16 kol = synth.kpa(pol);
  write("sample.wav", kol);
}
```
Execute dats file as `dats file.dats`

Note: This software is unstable, and more changes will have to come. 

PRs are warmly welcomed. Make sure you `clang-format -i *.[ch]` your source before doing so.
